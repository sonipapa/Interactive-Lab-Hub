# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.



For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. _Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

1. Set up [your Github "Lab Hub" repository](../../../) by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Spring/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to post links to your submissions on your readme.md so we can find them easily.

### For lab, you will need:

1. Paper
1. Markers/ Pen
1. Smart Phone--Main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
1. Computer--we will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls
1. Found objects and materials--you’ll have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other device. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case. Be creative!
1. Scissors

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process.
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction.
1. Submit these in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same for each person in the group.

## The Report
This readme.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done. You can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in the readme.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.
**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**

_Setting:_ This interaction happens on a work desk, when the user is concentrated on working and forgets to drink water on a regular basis.

_Players:_ Since water bottle is generally personal, the individual who owns this device will be involved in the interaction.

_Activity:_ when the device is on, the water bottle would remind the user hourly to drink water by having the light blinking. The light stops blinking when the water in the bottle decreases.

_Goals:_ Help the users to stay hydrated. The user would pick up the water bottle and drink water.

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 
**Include a picture of your storyboard here**
![Storyboard](https://github.com/sonipapa/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Spring2021/Lab%201/storyboard-mug.png)

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.
**Summarize feedback you got here.**

  * Instead of a smart bottle, make it a smart mug would be more suitable for the setting & goals. User who works on a desk does not need the water container to be portable, and if it needs to incorporate light, the battery size would reduce the portability.

  * Make the time interval of the reminder customizable instead of “one hour.”

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**

No. Things that physically acted out are pretty similar to things I've planned for, because they are simple interactions.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**

Instead of having the light blinking, glowing might be a better choice.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 
**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
It worked great on my phone & computer. The instruction for setup was pretty simple to follow.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**

The first attempt is enough for the interaction.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

**Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

* The device is a mug and has to be able to hold water as a normal mug no matter it's on or off, so it's designed to look alike a mug with the electronics (light/switch/charging port/battery etc.) at the bottom. 
* The material of the mug is transparent because this would maximize the light intensity as the whole device and even the liquid inside would glow when it's reminding the user. 
* The device is determined to have a simple design, considering that the weight should be as light as possible for the user to pick the mug up easily even when it's filled full.

## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

**Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 

I was in the breakout room with Yimeng Sun, Wenqing Tang, Renzhi Hu, and Panda Xu for part 1 of this lab. They all gave me insightful advice on my initial plan and their feedbacks were summarized in Part A.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

**Summarize feedback from your partners here.**

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors, 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

**Document everything here.**
